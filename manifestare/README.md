#Guide

This is an experimental website. To display reflections of life. It is written in react-typescript framework. 

It runs as image on github pages. The adress is www.manifestare.art . 

It is a hyper simple website front end wise. But over complicated back end wise. 

The logic. Quotes are stored in a data-base at jsonbin.io. Access controlled. Data limit. 

The website call such quotes with axios. By using controlled access. Json object read quotes and author. 

After the quotes are called. The quotes are displayed with Typed.js. 

Optionally. The website plays songs. Redux Store - controls play state. The songs are "la paloma" or "romanza". La paloma is a beautiful song. 

Why I did this?. To explore cloud capabilities. And keep learning. 

I think it is pretty cool to be honest. I love learning and applying technologies. Dude. Take this code and copy as much as you want.  

Hope you like it. Otherwise. Respectfully dimiss it. 

Juan Pablo.
