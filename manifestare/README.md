#Guide

This is an experimental website to display reflections of life. 

It is a hyper simple website front end wise. But over complicated back end wise. 

Such code calls a data base that displays quotes or reflections. 

Such reflections are stored in JsonObject free data tier in jsonbin.io. Access controlled.

The messages are read. Also. The code plays optionally songs. With Redux Store. It controls play state. 

Why I did this?. To explore cloud capabilities. And keep learning. And I think is just cool. 

Hope you like it. Otherwise. Respectfully dimiss it.
