This is an experimental website to display reflections of life. 

It is a hyper simple website front end wise. But over complicated back end wise. 

In this project. Such code calls a google API that displays quotes or reflections. 

Such reflections are stored in noSQL database free data tier in google cloud. 

Such data is then connected by google API service. 

This website calls the api by Api terminals. 

The messages are read. 

Why I did this?. To explore cloud capabilities from google. And keep learning. 


Hope you like it. Otherwise. Respectfully dimiss it.
