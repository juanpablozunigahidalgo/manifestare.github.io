This is an experimental website to display reflections of life. 

It is a hyper simple website front end wise. But over complicated back end wise. 

Such code calls a data base that displays quotes or reflections. 

Such reflections are stored in JsonObject free data tier in jsonbin.io. Access controlled.

The messages are read. 

Why I did this?. To explore cloud capabilities. And keep learning. And I think is just cool. 

Hope you like it. Otherwise. Respectfully dimiss it.

A human alive in planet earth. I also breath.
Lets pretend we free in life. Galton condition statistical principle.
